# CSS Basics

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that works in coordination with HTML, but has its own syntax. Where HTML governs the content of the page, CSS governs the style and appearance of the page by establishing a set of rules or **declarations** for how particular HTML elements are displayed. 

Using CSS, you can control many aspects of page style, including:

- Background color for a web page or a particular text element
- Size, font, and text decoration for headings and paragraph text
- Size and alignment of images
- Whether elements are visible to a user or not and where they appear on the page
