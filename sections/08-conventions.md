# Conventions

As we’ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you likely have noticed some common conventions or industry standards for creating a webpage using HTML. Can you guess any of these?

Here are a few examples:

- Some tags are self-closing, while others require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag. They also generally end with a backslash (`/`) to mark the end of the tag.
- Use lower case. While HTML is not case sensitive, it makes scanning the code easier, and makes it look more consistent.
- Your code should be indented, so that nested elements are easier to locate. This is not a technical necessity either — blank space has no meaning in html. However, this makes it easier to scan the code quickly, which is particularly helpful when you run into errors!
